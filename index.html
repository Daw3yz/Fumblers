                            your experience in romance. Haha, that aged well. We hung out in phillips
                            that night and had our first deep conversation.

                        <p>Actually a surprisingly fun day. We went to Ciputra world and had Carnaby's, then we walked
                            around IKEA and met your teacher Mr. Fabio,
                            you called me Felisho. Then we went around shopping and you put me in that stupid thrift
                            shop jacket HAHAHA. We got some boba after and hung
                            out around the parking lot, that was real fun. After that came the volunteer's dinner and we
                            won absolutely nothing... But at least we won each other???

                        <p>Pic says Oct 3, but you gave it earlier cuz u cudn't wait... It was also the day I got Rocket
                            and the heart letter you gave me. That was one long ass letter hahaha.
                            Made me realize, getting stuff actually feels pretty nice. It's nice because it reminds me
                            HOW MUCH YOU SIMP FOR ME.

                            I loved every word, I kept hearing your voice reading it, yek. Thank you for being your
                            usual hyper self while writing it, the letter really shows you had fun writing it.
                            In fact, ur hyper self is kinda what completes me yk, dead guy with a girl full of life. Try

                            together. All the memories we had
                            just doing stupid stuff til we slept on call. Even though we were busy at school or work we
                            still
                            wanted to be present for each other. Aunty Ita, if you're reading this, don't worry, pretty

                            you put into your crafts. I loved every single gift you gave. Especially the tiara, made me

                            The past year has been the most fun and fulfilling year of my life. You've still been the
                            amazing partner I fell in love with since day one.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Even though WE may make mistakes😒 and make each other sad I still feel warmth in my heart
                            when I'm with you. You've shown me how to enjoy the little things in life, the little
                            details that make everything so much more special.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            You always make my day way better every time you make a dumbass joke, absolutely roast me,
                            and ngambek to my ass. This sounds super masochistic, but what I'm tryna say is you funny as
                            hell and you light up my day.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            And even though we've been dating for a year, I'm still not used to your prettiness. I still
                            get mini heart attacks when I see you for the first time whenever we hangout. I'm not sure
                            if this is fear or awe. But hey, there's a little love in there somewhere.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            I hope that our dreams for the future all get fulfilled. I also hope we have fun through
                            each step along the way and we have our own little mini-adventures with whatever random BS
                            life throws at us.

                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I love you, and I'll still give you everything
