                        <p>This was the moment we actually began to get close. We went to Bentoya for lunch and had a conversation about 
                            your experience in romance. Haha, that aged well. We hung out in phillips
                            that night and had our first deep conversation.

                        <p>Actually a surprisingly fun day. We went to Ciputra world and had Carnaby's, then we walked around IKEA and met your teacher Mr. Fabio, 
                            you called me Felisho. Then we went around shopping and you put me in that stupid thrift shop jacket HAHAHA. We got some boba after and hung
                            out around the parking lot, that was real fun. After that came the volunteer's dinner and we won absolutely nothing... But at least we won each other???

                        <p>Pic says Oct 3, but you gave it earlier cuz u cudn't wait... It was also the day I got Rocket and the heart letter you gave me. That was one long ass letter hahaha.
                            Made me realize, getting stuff actually feels pretty nice. It's nice because it reminds me HOW MUCH YOU SIMP FOR ME.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I loved every word, I kept hearing your voice reading it, yek. Thank you for being your usual hyper self while writing it, the letter really shows you had fun writing it. 
                            In fact, ur hyper self is kinda what completes me yk, dead guy with a girl full of life. Try hovering over the photo btw...

                            just doing stupid stuff til we slept on call. Even though we were busy at school or work we still
                            wanted to be present for each other. Aunty Ita, if you're reading this, don't worry, pretty sure we both still got things done. </p>
